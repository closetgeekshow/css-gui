    # Modlet Workflow: Component Structure Best Practices

    ## Component Folder Structure
    myComponent/
        ├── myComponent.js         # Main component source file
        ├── myComponent.css        # Component-specific styles
        ├── myComponent.test.js    # Unit tests for the component
        ├── myComponent.md         # Component documentation
        ├── demo.html                # Interactive component demo page
        └── test.html                # Isolated component test page

    ## Key Principles
    1. Organize components as self-contained "mini-apps"
    2. Include all related files within a single component folder
    3. Create isolated demo and test pages for each component
    4. Ensure clear API boundaries between components
    5. Make components easily discoverable and understandable

    ## Benefits
    - Easier onboarding for new developers
    - Simplified debugging and testing
    - Improved component isolation
    - More maintainable and upgradeable code structure
    - Clear separation of concerns
