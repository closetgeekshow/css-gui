# Detailed Plan of Action

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system for creating procedurally generated web effects using standards-based technologies such as CSS, CSS variables, design tokens, JavaScript, and HTML. These effects can be either static or animated, and they will be composed based on templates or saved presets of parameters. The system will allow users to manipulate parameters using a user-friendly interface and export the necessary code to reproduce the effects.

## Key Objectives
- **Interface Development**: Build a React-based interface using the css.gui library to allow users to manipulate parameters of the effects.
- **Template and Preset Management**: Implement functionality to save, load, and manage templates and presets as JSON files.
- **Export Functionality**: Enable users to export the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML required to reproduce the effects.
- **Animation Support**: Integrate animation libraries to support both simple and complex animations.

## Detailed Action Plan

### 1. Initial Setup
- **Project Structure**: Establish a clear and organized project structure following the modlet pattern. This includes creating a dedicated folder for each component with its source file, styles, tests, documentation, and demo/test pages.
- **Tooling Setup**: Initialize the project with npm and set up build tooling using Vite for a faster development experience. Configure TypeScript for type safety, ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code quality, and Jest with React Testing Library for testing.

### 2. Core Development
- **Main Application Components**: Develop the main application components, including the App component and its associated files. Ensure each component is self-contained and follows best practices for modularity and reusability.
- **Effect System**: Implement the base Effect component template, including a CSS variable management system and parameter definition structure. Integrate css.gui controls for parameter manipulation and create an effect preview component.
- **Template System**: Design a JSON schema for effect templates and implement a loader/parser for handling templates. Develop a storage system for templates and enable export functionality.

### 3. UI and UX Enhancements
- **State Management**: Integrate lightweight state management using Zustand or Jotai to handle application state efficiently.
- **UI Components**: Utilize libraries like @radix-ui/react-primitives for accessible UI components, react-resizable for resizable panels, and react-split-pane for split view layouts.
- **Code Editing**: Incorporate Monaco Editor for a robust code editing experience with syntax highlighting and other advanced features.

### 4. Testing and Documentation
- **Testing Framework**: Set up a comprehensive testing framework with Jest and React Testing Library. Develop a basic test suite to ensure the reliability of components and features.
- **Documentation**: Write detailed documentation for each component, including usage examples and API documentation. Provide clear specifications for template and preset formats.

### 5. Export and Animation Support
- **Export Modules**: Develop modules for exporting CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Implement functionality for combined exports to facilitate easy sharing and integration of effects.
- **Animation Libraries**: Integrate animation libraries such as Framer Motion, GSAP, and react-spring to support a wide range of animations, from simple transitions to complex, physics-based animations.

### 6. Future Improvements
- **Visual Editors**: Plan for the development of visual editors for templates and presets to enhance user experience and simplify the creation process.
- **Advanced Features**: Consider integrating additional libraries or tools that could further enhance the functionality and performance of the application.

By following this detailed plan, the project will be well-structured, scalable, and equipped to deliver a powerful tool for generating and managing web effects.
