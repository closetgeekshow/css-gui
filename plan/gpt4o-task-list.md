# Detailed Task List and Action Plan for Project Scaffold

## Initial Setup & Structure
- [ ] **Create Base Project Folder Structure**
  - Follow the modlet pattern as outlined in `folderPattern.md`.
  - Ensure each component has its own directory with source, styles, tests, and documentation.

- [ ] **Initialize npm Project**
  - Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.
  - Define project metadata and initial scripts for build, start, and test.

- [ ] **Add Core Dependencies**
  - Install React and css.gui using npm.
  - Consider additional dependencies like styled-components or CSS Modules for styling.

- [ ] **Setup Build Tooling with Vite**
  - Configure Vite for development and production builds.
  - Set up hot module replacement for a better development experience.

- [ ] **Create Initial `.gitignore` File**
  - Include common exclusions like `node_modules`, `.env`, and build directories.

## Core Component Structure
- [ ] **Create Main `App` Component Folder Structure**
  - Develop `App.js` as the entry point of the application.
  - Style the application using `App.css`.
  - Write unit tests in `App.test.js`.
  - Document the component in `App.md`.
  - Create `demo.html` for interactive component demos.
  - Develop `test.html` for isolated component testing.

## Development Tools
- [ ] **Set Up TypeScript**
  - Configure TypeScript for type safety and create `tsconfig.json`.
  - Refactor JavaScript files to TypeScript as needed.

- [ ] **Configure ESLint and Prettier**
  - Set up ESLint for linting and code quality checks.
  - Integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting.
  - Create configuration files for both tools.

- [ ] **Set Up Jest and React Testing Library**
  - Install Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.
  - Write initial test cases to verify component functionality.

## Template and Preset Management
- [ ] **Design JSON Schema for Templates**
  - Define a schema for effect templates, including parameters and metadata.
  - Implement a loader/parser to handle template files.

- [ ] **Implement Template Storage System**
  - Use localforage for enhanced localStorage capabilities.
  - Develop functions to save, load, and manage templates.

- [ ] **Create Template Export Functionality**
  - Enable exporting of templates as JSON files.
  - Consider using jszip for bundling multiple templates.

## UI and UX Enhancements
- [ ] **Integrate State Management**
  - Choose between Zustand or Jotai for lightweight state management.
  - Implement global state handling for parameters and effects.

- [ ] **Enhance UI with Additional Libraries**
  - Use @radix-ui/react-primitives for accessible UI components.
  - Implement resizable panels with react-resizable.
  - Create split view layouts using react-split-pane.

- [ ] **Incorporate Monaco Editor**
  - Integrate Monaco Editor for code editing with syntax highlighting.
  - Provide a seamless editing experience for templates and presets.

## Export and Animation Support
- [ ] **Develop Export Modules**
  - Create modules for exporting CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
  - Implement combined export functionality for complete effect packages.

- [ ] **Integrate Animation Libraries**
  - Use Framer Motion for simple animations.
  - Consider GSAP for complex animations and transitions.
  - Explore react-spring for physics-based animations.

## Documentation
- [ ] **Write Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Document each component and its API.
  - Provide usage examples and detailed instructions.
  - Include specifications for template and preset formats.

## Testing & Demo
- [ ] **Setup Testing Framework**
  - Ensure Jest and React Testing Library are fully configured.
  - Write a comprehensive test suite covering all components and features.

- [ ] **Build Demo Page**
  - Create a demo page showcasing the application's capabilities.
  - Include interactive examples of effects and templates.
