# Plan of Action for css-gui Project

## Overview
The css-gui project aims to create a system for generating web effects using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The system will allow users to define, save, and export effects as templates and presets. This document outlines the steps to set up the project, implement core features, and ensure maintainability.

## Project Setup
1. **Initialize Project**
   - Set up a new Git repository.
   - Initialize a new npm project with `package.json`.
   - Install core dependencies: React, css.gui, styled-components, and Vite.

2. **Folder Structure**
   - Follow the modlet pattern for component organization.
   - Create a base folder structure:
     ```
     css-gui/
       ├── src/
       │   ├── components/
       │   ├── styles/
       │   ├── utils/
       │   └── index.js
       ├── public/
       ├── package.json
       ├── vite.config.js
       └── README.md
     ```

3. **Development Tools**
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality.
   - Configure Jest and React Testing Library for testing.
   - Use TypeScript for type safety.

## Core Features Implementation
1. **Effect System**
   - Develop a base `Effect` component with parameter controls.
   - Implement CSS variable management using css.gui.
   - Create a preview component to display effects.

2. **Template System**
   - Define a JSON schema for effect templates.
   - Implement functions to load, parse, and save templates.
   - Develop a UI for managing templates.

3. **Preset Management**
   - Design a data structure for presets.
   - Implement save/load functionality for presets.
   - Create a UI component for preset management.

4. **Export Functionality**
   - Develop modules to export CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
   - Implement a combined export feature for complete effects.
   - Use file-saver and jszip for downloading and bundling exports.

## Documentation
1. **Component Documentation**
   - Write JSDoc comments for all components and functions.
   - Create markdown files for component usage and API documentation.

2. **User Guides**
   - Develop guides for creating and managing templates and presets.
   - Include examples and best practices for using the system.

## Testing and Demo
1. **Testing**
   - Set up a comprehensive test suite covering all components.
   - Write unit tests for core functionalities and edge cases.

2. **Demo Page**
   - Build an interactive demo page showcasing example effects.
   - Include a variety of templates and presets for users to explore.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a text editor for writing and editing templates.
- Add visual editors for templates and presets.
- Explore additional animation libraries for enhanced effects.

## Conclusion
This plan provides a structured approach to developing the css-gui project, ensuring a scalable and maintainable system. By following this plan, the project will be well-organized, documented, and ready for future enhancements.
