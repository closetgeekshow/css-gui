# Detailed Task List and Action Plan for Project Scaffold

## Initial Setup & Structure
- [ ] **Create Base Project Folder Structure**
  - Follow the modlet pattern as outlined in `folderPattern.md`
  - Ensure each component has its own directory with source, styles, tests, and documentation

- [ ] **Initialize npm Project**
  - Run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file
  - Define project metadata and initial scripts for build, start, and test

- [ ] **Add Core Dependencies**
  - Install React and css.gui using npm
  - Consider additional dependencies like styled-components or CSS Modules for styling

- [ ] **Setup Build Tooling with Vite**
  - Configure Vite for development and production builds
  - Set up hot module replacement for a better development experience

- [ ] **Create Initial `.gitignore` File**
  - Include common exclusions like `node_modules`, `.env`, and build directories

## Core Component Structure
- [ ] **Create Main `App` Component Folder Structure**
  - Develop `App.js` as the entry point of the application
  - Style the application using `App.css`
  - Write unit tests in `App.test.js`
  - Document the component in `App.md`
  - Create `demo.html` for interactive component demos
  - Develop `test.html` for isolated component testing

## Development Tools
- [ ] **Set Up TypeScript**
  - Configure TypeScript for type safety and create `tsconfig.json`
  - Refactor JavaScript files to TypeScript as needed

- [ ] **Configure ESLint and Prettier**
  - Set up ESLint for linting and code quality checks
  - Integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - Create configuration files for both tools

- [ ] **Set Up Jest and React Testing Library**
  - Install Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing
  - Write initial test cases to verify component functionality
