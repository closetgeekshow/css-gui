Here's a comprehensive list of recommended libraries and prerequisites for your css-gui project:

Core Dependencies:

* React (UI framework)
* css.gui (parameter control interface)
* styled-components or CSS Modules (for scoped styling)
* react-router (for navigation between effects/templates)


Development Tools:

* Vite (faster build tooling than webpack)
* TypeScript (type safety for parameters/templates)
* ESLint + Prettier (code quality)
* Jest + React Testing Library (testing)


Storage/State Management:

* Zustand or Jotai (lightweight state management)
* localforage (enhanced localStorage for templates/presets)


Export/Import Functionality:

* file-saver (downloading generated files)
* jszip (bundling exported components)
* prettier (formatting exported code)


UI Enhancement:

* @radix-ui/react-primitives (accessible UI components)
* react-resizable (resize panels)
* react-split-pane (split view layouts)
* monaco-editor (code editing for templates)


Animation Support:

* Framer Motion (animations)
* GSAP (complex animations)
* react-spring (physics-based animations)
* Here's why these choices work well together:
 
1. Vite provides faster development experience than webpack
2. TypeScript ensures robust parameter typing and template validation
3. Zustand/Jotai are simpler alternatives to Redux for this use case
4. Radix UI provides accessible components that work well with css.gui
5. Monaco editor enables proper template editing with syntax highlighting
6. Let me know if you'd like specific implementation details for any of these libraries.
